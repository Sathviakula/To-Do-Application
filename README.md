A todo application, also known as a task management application or a task list application, is a software application designed to help individuals or teams manage and organize their tasks and responsibilities.

The primary purpose of a todo application is to provide a platform where users can create, update, delete, and prioritize tasks.

Typically, a todo application allows users to add tasks, set due dates or deadlines, and add additional details or descriptions to each task. Users can view their tasks in a list or a visual interface, where they can easily identify pending tasks, completed tasks, and tasks that are due or overdue.
